Python 2 reaches end of life on 1 January, 2020, according to [PEP
373](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/) and
[python/devguide#344](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/344). Many
of our dependencies (notably numpy, see their [Plan for dropping
Python 2.7
support](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/neps/dropping-python2.7-proposal.html))
have ceased Python 2.7 support in new releases or will also drop
Python 2.7 in 2020.

We know that science is rolling slowly and surely some scientific
projects will continue with Python 2.7 beyond 2020. MDAnalysis has
been supporting Python 2 and Python 3 now for a while. However, given
how precious developer time is, we also decided to drop support soon
after the official Python 2.7 drop date. 

Our plan is to give researchers a stable legacy platform and release
**MDAnalysis 1.0.0** with full Python 2.7 support and tests. However,
no major development will continue in 1.0. Issues will only be fixed
and backported on a best-effort basis, simply because there are not
enough developers to do this work.

We will then work towards **MDAnalysis 2.0.0**,  which will
only support Python 3.



## Tentative Roadmap
### 2020 (1st quarter)

- release **1.0.0** in early 2020 (maybe end of 2019...)
   - 1.x will be the last version of MDAnalysis that fully supports Python 2.7
   - 1.0 will be similar to upcoming 0.21 (i.e., no  major annoying
        API breaks but clean-up and deprecations)
   - development on 1.x will cease with the release of 2.0; we will
     consider PRs that backport fixes but we will not officially
     support it after the release of 2.0
- finalize API decisions for 2.0.0

### 2020 (2nd quarter)

- release **2.0.0**
    - officially drop Python 2.7 support
    - support all current Python 3.x releases	
	- include larger changes/deprecations (API breaks compared to
      1.0.0 if necessary, removal of legacy code, etc)
- code modernization (making use of specific Python 3 constructs) will
  be ongoing
